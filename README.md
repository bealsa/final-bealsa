Special requirements/packages: API key for OMDb, Plotly, and Flask

Records are retrieved from IMDb and OMDb and 20 records are stored in a sql database file. 

When the python file is executed, the Flask technology creates a link for the user to open in the browser. 

Once the user opens the link in the browser, they are able to search a movie title on the homepage.

The user can then navigate to the graping page ('/graph') and have filter options to create the graph/table.

Plotly is used to create the bar graphs and 10 of the 20 records stored in the sql database file are displayed based on the user's chosen filter options.
